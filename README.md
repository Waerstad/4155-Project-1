## Project 1 for FYS-STK 4155 at UiO.
By John-Magnus Johnsen & Simen Lund WÃ¦rstad

This project discusses the linear regression methods ordinary least squares (OLS), ridge, and LASSO. In addition, we discuss various gradient descent methods, including ordinary gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, momuentum, ADAgrad, RMSprop, and ADAM. We also discuss the bias-variance trade-off as well as resampling methods.

The required python packages are included in the file `requirements.txt`. To install these packages run the command
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
